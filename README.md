How to create the tidy data set:
    1) Download the compressed raw data from the following link:
       https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
    2) Download the script required to transform the raw data into tidy data ('run_analysis.R')
    3) Unzip raw data in any folder and copy the path and assign it to the variable 'Req_WD' at the start of the code  
    4) Run the entire code and you will find the tidy dataset by the name "Sensor_Mean_Subject_Activity.txt" in the same location as 'Req_WD'.
